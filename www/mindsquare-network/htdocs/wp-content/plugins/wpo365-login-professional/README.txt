== Description ==

Wordpress + Office 365 login premium allows Microsoft O365 users to seamlessly and securely log on to your corporate Wordpress intranet: No username or password required. Why you need this, you may wonder. Because this way you can ensure that your corporate content such as news, documents etc. that is normally classified as "Internal" or maybe even "Confidential" is not available to just any pair of curious unauthenticated eyes!

== Upgrade Notice ==

* v8.3 The previous solution to redirect users via /wp-admin in an attempt to bypass server-side cache (and avoid "Your login has been tampered with" errors) has been discontinued. Redirection to login.onmicrosoft.com is now delegated to a client-side solution. Please ensure that the WordPress REST API i.e. https://www.example.com/wp-json/wpo365/ is not blocked e.g. by basic auth, another plugin or your firewall.
* v8.0 As a result of switching to a client-side solution (to redirect users) the plugin no longer requires you to use the WordPress Admin URL as the Azure AD App registration Redirect URI. Instead you can now simply use your website's base website address e.g. https://www.example.com/ (but don't forget the trailing slash).
* v8.0 When the client-side solution (to redirect users) is not working as expected you can enable a fallback that uses server-side redirection by checking the "Use server side redirect" option on the miscellaneous tab of the plugin's wizard. This option, however, does not try and bypass server-side cache and as a result you may start seeing "Your login has been tampered with" errors again.
* v8.0 When using the "Sign in with Microsoft" shortcode you're advised to upgrade to version 2 of the shortcode and take advantage of the new client-side redirection to work around server-side caching issues. See https://www.wpo365.com/authentication-shortcode/ for details.
* v8.0 When using the "Dual Login" feature (previously referred to as "Redirect to login") you are advised to start using version 2 of the template and take advantage of the new client-side redirection to work around server-side caching issues. See https://www.wpo365.com/redirect-to-login/ for details.
* v7.18 Please update your Azure AD App registration to avoid "Could not create or retrieve your login. Please contact your System Administrator." errors and users not being able to have their account created or login into the website. See https://www.wpo365.com/azure-application-registration/ for details.
* v7.18 When you still see "Could not create or retrieve your login" errors you can enable a fallback that users the older ID token parser by chcking the "Use older ID token parser" option on the miscellaneous tab of the plugin's wizard.

There is a [new video](https://youtu.be/fNrwX24p1gU) available on YouTube that covers the updated configuration (for v7.18, not for v8.0) in detail.

== Changelog ==

= v9.4 =
* Improvement: An administrator can now configure the plugin to automatically assign users a WordPress role by creating one or more mappings between a (username's login) domain on the one side and a WordPress role on the other side. Visit https://www.wpo365.com/domain-roles-mappings/.
* Improvement: Added support for so-called Azure single sign out. Visit https://www.wpo365.com/enable-logout-without-confirmation/.
* Improvement: An administrator can now configure a domain hint to prevent users that are already logged on toanother Azure AD / Office 365 tenant from signing in with possibly the wrong Microsoft work or school account. Visit https://www.wpo365.com/domain-hint/.
* Improvement: The plugin, when receiving the authentication response from Microsoft, will now additionally search in WordPress for users by account name i.e. the user's principal name (= Office 365 login name) without the domain suffix. However, please be aware that some plugin features expect a WordPress username to be a legitimate Azure AD login name. Features not working when the WordPress user name is not a fully qualified Azure AD user principal name are the Avatar synchronization, mapping of Azure AD group memberships to WordPress roles and adding additional Office 365 user profile properties to a user's WordPress and / or BuddyPress profile as well as the deep integration in MS Graph and SharePoint Online.
* Improvement: Some 3rd party themes and plugins that hook into the user_register action e.g. to send an email with a confirmation link, would run into a fatal error when the action was triggered. This new configuration setting (on the Miscellaneous tab) - when checked - is a work-around to disable the action from being triggered (when a new user is created automatically by the plugin). Visit https://www.wpo365.com/skip-user-register-action/.
* Fix: Error "Undefined variable: resource Auth.php on line 774".

= v9.3 =
* Change: The plugin now ships with a built-in SharePoint Online Documents app (see https://www.wpo365.com/documents/). 
* Improvement: A new setting "Retrieve all group memberships" allows you to retrieve all sorts of groups memberships when synchronizing users instead of only the security-enabled group memberships.

= v9.2 =
* Fix: Now getting / setting WordPress transients take into account WordPress multisite to prevent "Your login has been tampered with" error when signing into a subsite (when authentication configuration is shared between all sites in the network).

= v9.1 =
* Improvement: Optionally you can specify your custom query when synchronizing users.
* Improvement: Optionally you can specify a Welcome Page URL where new users are sent after they signed on with Microsoft the very first time.
* Improvement: You can now (try to) activate your license.
* Fix: When redirecting, the plugin now writes a proper HTML document incl. doctype.
* Fix: The plugin now tries to obtain the initial URL the users intended to load on the client to preserve query parameters and fragments (hash).

= v9.0 =
* Change: The plugin now ships with a built-in SharePoint Online Search app (see https://www.wpo365.com/content-by-search/). 
* Change: The plugin now ships with a built-in Employee Directory app that queries Microsoft Graph (see https://www.wpo365.com/employee-directory/).
* Change: When using BuddyPress you can now instruct the plugin to show the Office 365 profile picture instead.
* Fix: When synchronizing users the plugin will now also update core user fields (email, first name, last name, display name).
* Fix: When synchronizing users the plugin will now also retrieve a user's Office 365 profile picture (if this feature is enabled and if an older version that has not yet expired is not found).
* Fix: If the plugin detects a different scheme between the Azure AD redirect URL and the URL the user navigated to before the SSO workflow started the plugin autocorrects the scheme (changes http:// to https://) to avoid infinite loops. An error will be generated in the log and the admin should take appropriate measures e.g. updating .htaccess to ensure the site automatically redirects to its secure version.

= 8.6 =
* Fix: The plugin will only (try to) retrieve additional user fields (from O365) if the user signed in with Microsoft (assumption made by analyzing the email domain).
* Fix: When the Dual Login feature is activated, the plugin now redirects the user to the WordPress site instead to initiate the login workflow.
* Fix: A typo caused the BASIC edition to cause a warning when trying to show the discount banner.
* Fix: When redirecting to Microsoft the plugin would sometimes not remember the state correctly, resulting in a login error.
* Fix: Cache buster for the wizard was not set correctly and therefore wizard updates were not immediately visible after an upgrade.
* Fix: More robust detection whether WordPress is loaded in an iframe.

= 8.5 =
* Change: Now the plugin will no longer require access to WP REST API or WP AJAX API. Instead the plugin adds an additional POST request to trigger the Single Sign-on workflow. This request uses a cache breaker to work-around server-side cache, allowing admins to configure the home url (instead of the WP Admin url) as a Redirect URI for the Azure AD App registration.
* Change: User synchronization no longer requires (unattended) access to the WP AJAX API. Instead the plugin will "loop" until all users found in Microsoft Graph have been processed. For the admin starting the synchronization this will appear as a synchronous action but in reality the synchronization is executed in batches of 10 users. By doing so the synchronization will not eventually time out (but as a drawback can also not be executed unattended).

= 8.4 =
* Fix: Removed the "too" opinionated validation of schemes used for redirect URI and WordPress URL.
* Fix: Improved the detection of HTTPS (but it is up to the administrator to ensure SSL is being enforced for the front and back end).
* Fix: Removed dead code.

= 8.3 =
* Change: Moved the custom API for users to obtain the Microsoft authentication endpoint e.g. login.microsoftonline.com to the WordPress REST API. Please ensure that this endpoint i.e. https://www.example.com/wp-json/wpo365/ is not blocked e.g. by basic auth, another plugin or your firewall.
* Change: If the custom (WP REST) API is not available to end users (e.g. because it is disabled or blocked) the user will see an error message and instructions on how to resolve the issue are printed to the developer console (F12).
* Change: The option to bypass the NONCE verification (at your own risk) to work around server-side cache has been re-activated. This options should only be used in combination with SSL.
* Change: The client-side redirect script will try and detect if it's being loaded in an iframe (which is by default not supported by Microsoft) and if this is the case it will try and open a popup instead. Please make sure popup blockers are disable for your domain, if you are trying to place your website in an iframe. For Internet Explorer / Edge please make sure that login.microsoftonline.com and your website are both added to the same security zone.
* Change: Logging has been improved with a filter to only show errors and error descriptions now offer more guidance on how they can be resolved.
* Fix: When WordPress multisite has been installed, the plugin will detect when the user changes the (sub) site (when the admin configured WPO_MU_USE_SUBSITE_OPTIONS (true)) and if this is the case signs out the user and eventually redirects the user to Microsoft to authenticate for the new (sub) site.

= 8.2 =
* Fix: WPO365 admin menu not available when WPO_MU_USE_SUBSITE_OPTIONS (true) has been configured.
* Fix: O365 user fields now requested using the user's principal name (upn) instead of email address.

= 8.1 =
* Fix: Compatibility with older browsers, specifically IE11.
* Fix: Added a plugcache breaker when loading pintra-redirectjs.

= 8.0 =
* Change: To work-around server-side caching the previous solution to redirect via /wp-admin has been discontinued. Instead the plugin will now output a short (cachable) JavaScript that will request the authentication URL from a custom WordPress AJAX service and redirect the user accordingly.
* Change: The way nonces are generated and validated has been changed to ensure that nonces are really used only once.
* Change: A version 2 of the "Sign-in with Microsoft" shortcode has been added to take advantage of the beforementioned client-side redirection to prevent server-side caching. Older "Sign-in with Microsoft" shortcode templates will continue to work but it is recommended that they are updated accordingly.
* Change: A version 2 of the "Dual Login" feature (= previously referred to as "Redirect to login")  has been added to take advantage of the beforementioned client-side redirection to prevent server-side caching. Older Dual Login templates will continue to work but it is recommended that they are updated accordingly.
* Change: The plugin now requires that the Azure AD "Redirect URI" and your WordPress (Site) Address use the same scheme e.g. http(s). If this is not the case it will show a "Plugin is not configured" error and will basically disable it self, to prevent infinite loops.
* Change: Debug log will now show the debug in descending order (latest entries first).
* Change: The plugin will now try and automatically add a trailing slash whenever it tries to redirect the user.
* Change: When using the "Dual Login" feature (= previously referred to as Redirect to login) the plugin will now remember the URL the user initially requested and redirect the user accordingly upon successful authentication.
* Change: The plugin's wizard "Test authentication" button has been removed. Instead the configuration is always saved and then tested. The authentication URL used for testing will now appear after clicking "Save configuration" since this URL (and the corresponding nonce) is generated server-side and must be unique.
* Fix: A legacy function to prevent client-side caching that generated unnecessary error log entries (and thus unnecessary warnings in WP admin) has been removed.

= 7.18 =
* Change: The plugin will regularly check the error log to see if recently new errors were logged and if so show a dismissable notice in the WordPress admin area.
* Change: The administrator can choose to surpress the error notice in the WordPress admin area.
* Fix: Improved the improved way of parsing the ID token (trying to get the user principal name first if available).
* Fix: The plugin would throw an previously uncaught exception when trying to log an event when the synchronization of users would fail.

= 7.17 =
* Change: Now that Microsoft has made the new Azure App registration portal General Available, the recommended Azure AD endpoint to use is v2.0 (see https://www.wpo365.com/azure-application-registration/)
* Change: The plugin now supports retrieving manager data (display name, email, telephone number(s), office location, country) of an O365 user through Microsoft Graph.
* Change: When configuring "Redirect to login" you can now choose to hide the SSO link which is otherwise shown above the login form.
* Change: You can now configure a custom login URL (which is automatically added to the Pages Blacklist).
* Fix: Improved way of parsing the ID token, avoiding unexpected WP user names, especially for Azure AD guests and users from other tenants.
* Fix: Display name property now correctly set when creating a new WP user using the information from the parsed ID token.
* Fix: Now the plugin will check - when multisite is activated - whether the logged in user autenticated for the current site and if not the user will be logged out and forced to authenticate again.
* Fix: WP user now created with a stronger default password.

= 7.16 =
* Fix: Improved caching of license check result to prevent it from impacting the overall website performance.
* Fix: Now the wizard is loaded with a cache breaker to ensure with each new plugin version the latest version shows immediately.
* Fix: White spaces at the beginning and end of configuration options that are strings are now properly trimmed.

= 7.15 =
* Change: Added software licensing and replaced automated upgrade with license key based solution (professional and premium version).
* Fix: Additional logging when synchronizing user (premium version).

= 7.14 =
* Change: Added an extra option (see Miscellaneous tab of the plugin's configuration wizard) to prevent the wp-login hook from being fired as it may cause an error in combination with some 3rd party themes.
* Fix: The plugin now recognize the super administrator (available only for WordPress multisite) as an administrator of (any) subsite.

= 7.13 =
* Fix: The plugin now checks whether a user is an administrator by verifying roles instead of capabilities.
* Fix: The plugin's URL cache now resolves the WordPress home URL instead of the site address for the website's front end home.
* Fix: The plugin now correctly recognizes a "bounced" request when preparing to redirect the user to Microsoft's authentication endpoint.

= 7.12 =
* Change: The plugin can be configured to skip authentication when requesting data from the WordPress REST API when a Basic authentication header is present (professional and premium editions only).
* Change: You can configure the plugin to skip nonce verification (however, it is not recommended to do so but instead find the root cause e.g. an aggressive server-side caching strategy).
* Change: User synchronization is now supported at the level of a (sub) site in a WordPress Multisite WPMU network (premium edition only).
* Change: User synchronization now checks user capabilities and won't delete users that have the administrator capability (premium edition only).
* Fix: Check for admin capabilities would not always return true for a WordPress Multisite WPMU Network.
* Fix: Due to a regression the number of user synced per batch was set to 1 instead of 10 (premium edition only).
* Fix: Manual login attempts will now be intercepted even when redirect to login is checked (professional and premium editions only).

= 7.11 =
* Change: User Synchronization is now executed in asynchronous batches of 25 users each until finished to prevent a timeout exception. As soon as the asynchronous user synchronization has finished the plugin will (try and) send an email to website's administrator (premium version only).
* Change: When you have selected the Intranet (Authentication) Scenario, you can check the "Public Homepage" option to allow anonymous access to the WordPress frontpage i.e. your website's home page (premium and professional version only).
* Change: A direct link to the WPO365 Wizard has been added to the Admin Dashboard Menu.
* Change: You can now toggle debug mode comfortably from the "Debug" tab that has been added to the plugin's configuration wizard. The debug log can now be viewed on that tab as well and you can copy the log to the clipboard.
* Change: The plugin now partially obscures a number of configuration secrets e.g. application ID, application secret, nonce etc.
* Change: The plugin's wizard has been enhanced with a number of warnings in the form of popups to provide more guidance when configuring the plugin.
* Fix: Synchronizing external users has been improved and the user name configured by the plugin is the external user's own email address (instead of the - sanitized - Azure AD User Principal Name) (premium version only).
* Fix: When a user - for any reason - cannot be created, the plugin would try and log that user's ID, causing an irrecoverable exception, which is now caught and logged adequately.

= 7.10 =
* Fix: Stricter validation of the Error Page URL and Pages Blacklist entries to ensure that the website is not accidently added (causing the plugin to skip authentication alltogether).
* Fix: Automatic update for the PROFESSIONAL edition failed.

= 7.9 =
* Fix: Custom error messages were ignored due to an error with the property's casing.
* Change: The professional and premium version now offer a "Redirect to login" option that when checked will send the user to the default WordPress login form (instead of the Microsoft) and on the login form a message will inform the user that he / she can also sign into the website using his / her Microsoft Office 365 / Azure AD account (and provide a link that when clicked will sign in the user with Microsoft)

= 7.8 =
* Fix: Auto-fix for bypassing server-side cache dind't work as expected.
* Change: The BASIC edition will now show an appropriate error message when user not found.
* Change: Added a short code that can be used on a custom error page to display the plugin's error message.

= 7.7 =
* Fix: Removed "Plugin not configured" error redirection which prevented users to logon with their WordPress-only admin account when then plugin was not yet configured.
* Fix: (Smoke) Tested against PHP 7.3.3 and replaced deprecated create_function call.

= 7.6 =
* Change: When you change the authentication scenario to "Internet" the Pages Blacklist will be replaced by a Private Pages list. Posts and Pages added to the new Private Pages list will only be accessible for authenticated users. If the user is authenticated, the plugin will try and sign in the user with Microsoft.
* Change: You can now configure an Error Page. When configured, the plugin will redirect the user to this page each time it runs into an error e.g. user not found, plugin not configured etc. If no Error Page is configured, the plugin will instead redirect the user to the default WordPress login form. The plugin will automatically skip the Error Page when authenticate a request (to avoid an infinite loop). The error code will be sent along as query string parameter and can be used to customize your own Error Page.
* Fix: Added MIME Type and Content Headers to the New User Notification email template.

= 7.5 =
* Change: The plugin can now be configured to send a (customizable) new user registration email.  See <a href="https://www.wpo365.com/new-user-email/">online documentation</a> for details.

= 7.4 =
* Fix: If a user is not manually registered prior to trying to sign into the WordPress site with Microsoft, the user would end up in an infinite loop (only impacts basic version).
* Fix: Remove crossorigin from Pintra Fx template since this was causing an issue downloading react files from UNPKG CDN.

= 7.3 =
* Fix: A new setting "Don't try bypass (server side) cache" on the Miscellaneous Tab now controls whether the plugin will try and bypass the server side cache by redirecting the user first to /wp-admin before redirecting the user to Microsoft's Identity Provider.
* Fix: A new global constant WPO_MU_USE_SUBSITE_OPTIONS allows administrators of a WordPress multisite network to toggle between a "shared" scenario in which all subsites in the network share the same Azure AD application registration and a "dedicated" scenario in which all sites in the network will have to be configured individually. 

= 7.2 =
* Fix: Missing namespace import causing server error when user cannot be added successfully [professional, premium]

= 7.1 =
* Change: Now the plugin can redirect users based on their Azure AD Group Membership [premium]
* Fix: User synchronization would not work correctly with Graph Version set to beta
* Fix: Added support for wp_login hook
* Fix: Lowered priority when hooking into the wp_authenticate hook

= 7.0 =
* Plugin options are now managed through a new Wizard app that can be opened from the WordPress Plugins page where a new action link has been added to the wpo365-login plugin
